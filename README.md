## Description

This is an iOS, Objective-C alternative to `UIImagePickerController` that looks almost exactly the same, but provides the ability to select multiple images. It's as easy to setup as `UIImagePickerController` and it works in both portrait and landscape orientations. It requires the addition of **AssetsLibrary.framework**. This code uses **ARC**.

*Note: Using AssetsLibrary.framework will prompt users to allow use of their location data in order to access their photos.*

## Adding to your project

There are a few ways to add `WSAssetPickerController` to your project. 

**Option 1:** Build and add the static library to your project:

1. Open the demo project
2. Select the `WSAssetPickerCombined` scheme
3. In the menu bar choose Product > Build
5. Copy the generated `WSAssetPicker` directory (found in the builds folder in the project directory) into your project.
6. Make sure that `libWSAssetPicker-Combined.a` has been added to your targets Build Phases
    
**Option 2:** 
Copy all the files in the `src` directory into your project and be sure 'Copy items to destination group's folder' is checked

**Option 3:**
You can also get the code via CocoaPods (thanks [@AlexIzvekov](https://github.com/AlexIzvekov))

## Use

1. Import the header using `#import "WSAssetPicker.h"`
2. Create an instance of `WSAssetPickerController` passing a delegate of type `id <WSAssetPickerControllerDelegate>`
3. Present the `WSAssetPickerController` instance
4. Implement the delegate methods
5. You will also need to include the selection state `png` files: `WSAssetViewSelectionIndicator.png` and `WSAssetViewSelectionIndicator@2x.png` or make your own.
6. You can use setAssetGroupTypes: and setAssetsFilter: to enable video picking. Include `WSAssetViewVideoIndicator.png` and `WSAssetViewVideoIndicator@2x.png`.


####Initialization and presentation
```` objective-c
WSAssetPickerController *controller = [[WSAssetPickerController alloc] initWithDelegate:self];
[self presentViewController:controller animated:YES completion:NULL];
````

#### Delegate Methods
```` objective-c

- (void)assetPickerControllerDidCancel:(WSAssetPickerController *)sender
{
    // Dismiss the WSAssetPickerController.
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:NULL];
}

- (void)assetPickerController:(WSAssetPickerController *)sender didFinishPickingMediaWithAssets:(NSArray *)assets
{
    // Hang on to the picker to avoid ALAssetsLibrary from being released (see note below).
    self.picker = sender;

    // Dismiss the WSAssetPickerController.
    __block id weakSelf = self;
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{
        
        // Do something with the assets here.
        
        
        // Release the picker.
        [weakSelf setPicker:nil];
    }];
}

*Note: The `ALAsset` objects in the `assets` array are only valid while the `ALAssetsLibrary` instance they came from still exists.
(The `ALAssetsLibrary` is created in the picker controller implementation)*
